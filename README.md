# MVPApplication

The Galaxy-based MVP visualization plugin enables viewing of results produced from workflows integrating genomic sequencing data and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data, commonly known as proteogenomics. The multi-functional tool allows for organization and filtering of results, quality assessment of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data matched to peptide sequences, and visualization of data at both the protein and gene level. A user can, with relatively few keystrokes, filter and order large datasets down to a manageable subset. Due to the tools use of server-side caching, large data sets are handled as quickly as small datasets.
